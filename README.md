# Blup

This repository contains _Blup_, a system designed by Paula BÃ¶hm for the scenario of the [16th Multi-Agent Programming Contest](https://multiagentcontest.org/2022/) (MAPC).
It utilizes constraint optimization to determine the actions of the agents using the [Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver).

# How to Use

This project uses the Gradle build system, which builds all components using the following command:

```sh
gradle assemble
```

To execute the agents, the following commands suffice:

```sh
gradle :agent:jar
java -jar ./agent/build/libs/agent.jar conf/BasicAgents/
```
